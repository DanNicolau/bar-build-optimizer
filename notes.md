## variations

we just need a simple set of instructions that can traverse the entire solution space rather uniformly...

the variation is a variation of the build order - a reclaim is still an addition to the build order

variations can be the following (for now... in the future, swap may provide more "solution mobility" if that's even useful)
- remove a step at a random index
- add a step at a random index

### what kind of steps are there?
for now just the following: (wait x time may actually be a really useful one but it's not high prio because we can just keep build-reclaim-build-reclaim a turbine or something)
- build something
- reclaim something
- self desctruct the commander

## evaluation

just need to calculate the time to complete the build order or return something close to infinite
